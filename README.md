# ðŸ“š Explanation

- **`SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS user_count`** â†’ Selects the `department` column and counts the number of users in each department. The result is labeled as `user_count`.  
- **`FROM users`** â†’ Specifies the `users` table to query.  
- **`WHERE age > 25`** â†’ Filters records where `age` is **greater than 25**.  
- **`GROUP BY department`** â†’ Groups the filtered results by `department`.  
- **`HAVING COUNT(*) >= 1`** â†’ Includes only groups that have **at least 1 user** in the result.  
    - `HAVING` is used to filter groups **after aggregation**, while `WHERE` filters individual rows **before aggregation**.
